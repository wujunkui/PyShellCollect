[h1]Patchlist[/h1]
v1.0 - Released.
v1.1 - Fixed Issues when using it with a Language Pack (tested only on Russian LP). Actually this is a rewrite of most of the script (like 50%-70% was modified). But it should has slightly better performance that it was or none at all.
v1.2 - Fixed clients crashed upon joining a game.
v1.2.1 - Fixed mouse over not showing when equiping on hand slot.
v1.3 - Fixed hover message showing incorrectly for certain specific actions (e.g cooking). Added configuration to select either Value or Percentage or Both. And changed the icon :D
v1.3.1 - Fixed crash due to a missing file (i was testing something, sorry).
v1.4.0 - Added support for controller. Also added option to use different Modes.
v1.4.1 - Fixed crash issues when trying to plant/build something when using Mode A.
v1.4.2 - Add a 'NaN' check before updating health numbers.
v1.4.3 - Optimize the mod (now properly check if the entity actually have health before adding the healthinfo).
v1.4.4 - Fixed issues on v1.4.3. Also removed Modes as it doesn't seems to serve any _real_ benefits.
v1.4.5 - Added more check tags for other entities that should also display health.
v1.4.6 - Fixed controller crashing issue (recent update)
v1.4.7 - Added a new option to choose the block style.
v2.0.0 - Refactoring. Removed component. Changed injection algorithms. Improved compatibility with other mods and future updates of the game. Now mod is more simple and stable. Used cache for initialization, improved speed (less CPU usage). Changed icon size to 128x128 (no more warnings in log file about wrong size).
